## Welcome to AltairCare!

Artificial intelligence is a rapidly advancing field that is revolutionizing various industries, including agriculture, banking, healthcare, and travel. In the healthcare sector, AI has garnered significant attention from tech giants like Microsoft, Google, Apple, and IBM. Why? Because AI simplifies the lives of patients, doctors, and hospital administrators by automating tasks traditionally performed by humans. This not only saves time but also reduces costs. AI also enables the delivery of medical services in remote and inaccessible areas and can diagnose diseases in their early stages, significantly improving the chances of recovery.

Introducing AltairCare, an innovative healthcare AI web application that leverages machine learning and deep learning algorithms to provide users with highly accurate disease prediction models. With AltairCare, users can assess their risk of developing various diseases, including:

- Liver Disease
- Pneumonia
- Kidney Disease
- Diabetes
- Stroke
- Heart Disease
